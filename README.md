A project to allow for the creation and manipulation of a 3D object (a house),
as well as the rending of text within our 3D space.

Executable files for this project are found in /bin/

Thanks to Avery Zebell for teaching me how to create and modify code libraries,
and for providing some functions for point manipulation from his zgeom library.
