A project to allow for the creation and manipulation of a 3D object (a house),
as well as the rending of text within our 3D space.

Executable files for this project are found in /bin/

Every single line of the Makefile has been commented to prove I understand
what I have done in the makefile and to make it accessible

Project Details: http://theochem.mercer.edu/csc315/homeworks/prog3_f18.pdf

Notes:
Thanks Avery Zebell for teaching me how to make my code into a library.

<- IMPORTANT COMMAND FOR LATER ->
$ gcc -gdwarf-3 file.cpp
